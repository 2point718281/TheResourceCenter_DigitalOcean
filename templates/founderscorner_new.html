<p><b>Hello, I'm Krivan Mirok</b>, the founder of <b>The
Resource Center</b>. I'm a 12-year-old innovator from Surrey, BC, and I have a
passion for <b>math</b>, <b>coding</b>, and <b>AI</b>. From a young age, I've
always been fascinated by how the world works, especially how technology can be
used to solve problems. My love for STEM grew as I realized that skills in
science, math, and engineering govern and build our world.</p>

<p>When I was younger, the traditional one-size-fits-all
approach to education didn't suit me. My parents spent countless hours
searching for resources that aligned with my learning needs, and I realized
that many other students face the same challenge. That's what inspired me to
create <b>The Resource Center</b>, a platform that provides <b>personalized
learning plans</b> and tailored resources to help every student achieve their
full potential.</p>

<p>My goal is to make education more accessible, equitable, and
personalized for all students, so they can find what works best for them
without feeling lost in the overwhelming sea of information available online.</p>

<p>Through <b>The Resource Center</b>, I hope to show students,
parents, and educators how AI can be a powerful assistant, helping us tailor
learning experiences to suit individual needs. My dream is to see every
student, no matter where they are or what their strengths, thrive with the
right resources at their fingertips.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting my platform! I hope <b>The Resource
Center</b> becomes a valuable tool in your educational journey.</p>
