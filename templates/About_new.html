    </p>
    <p>
        The Resource Center is an innovative, AI-driven platform dedicated to making education more accessible, personalized, and effective for K-12 students in British Columbia and beyond.

        <li style="margin-left:27.6pt; line-height:108%; padding-left:8.4pt; font-family:serif; font-size:10pt">
            <strong><span style="line-height:108%; font-family:Aptos; font-size:11pt; ">Personalized Learning Plan (PLP) Generator</span></strong><span style="line-height:108%; font-family:Aptos; font-size:11pt">: This feature creates a customized learning plan based on each student's strengths, areas for improvement, and goals.

        <strong>Why We’re Unique</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Unlike existing resources, The Resource Center is free (with subscription options), localized, and exclusively designed to cater to K-12 needs, focusing on curated, relevant content that supports both foundational and advanced learning requirements. Our platform stands out because we connect users to valuable resources, not just generic tools, making learning accessible and meaningful.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Looking Ahead</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Our journey is just beginning. As we grow, The Resource Center aims to expand across Canada, continuously improving through user feedback, refining our AI-driven insights, and developing dedicated spaces for teachers, parents, and students to meet their unique needs.
    </p>
    <p>
        Together, we are making personalized learning accessible to all — because every student deserves the opportunity to thrive.
