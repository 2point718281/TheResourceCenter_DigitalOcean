				Hello, I'm Krivan Mirok, the founder of The Resource Center. From a young age, I've been driven by a passion for math, coding, and AI, and I've always been fascinated by how technology can solve real-world problems. My interest in STEM grew as I recognized how these skills play a vital role in shaping our world.
			</p>
			<p>
				Like many students, I found that the traditional one-size-fits-all approach to education didn't align with my learning style. After seeing the time and effort my parents put into finding resources that fit my needs, I realized that many other students encounter similar challenges. This experience inspired me to create The Resource Center - a platform that provides personalized learning plans and curated resources to help each student reach their full potential.
			</p>
			<p>
				My goal is to make education more accessible, equitable, and tailored to individual learning needs, so students can navigate the vast landscape of online resources with confidence. Through The Resource Center, I hope to show students, parents, and educators how AI can enhance education by creating custom learning experiences that honor each learner's unique strengths and challenges.

			<p>
				Thank you for visiting The Resource Center! I hope it becomes a valuable tool in your educational journey.
